# UX-UI-Responsive-Design

This repository serves as a portfolio of studies and practical projects in User Experience (UX) and Responsive Design. My goal is to apply the concepts of usability and adaptability to build prototypes of web interfaces that are intuitive and functional on any device, from desktop to mobile.

This project demonstrates my dedication to creating not only robust technical solutions, but also digital products that meet user needs and provide a high-quality experience.

Concepts and Prototypes:

> Responsive Design: Focuses on fluid and flexible layouts that automatically adjust to the screen, utilizing Mobile-First principles and Media Queries.

> Prototyping: Creation of wireframes and interactive prototypes to visualize and test user flow and information architecture.

> UX Fundamentals: Application of concepts such as visual hierarchy, interface feedback, and basic accessibility to ensure usability.
